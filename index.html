            <h2>Tetris Inventory</h2>
            <p>This project was developed as part of my Games Engine Programming module, with my own personal goal of building a complex, Tetris-style inventory system in Unity. The system supports three item types including weapons, food, and potions that grant various affects the player. It features grid-based item placement and rotation. This project showcases my ability to prototype complex systems; initially, I experimented with an observable pattern but switched to a singleton approach for efficiency, which allowed me to complete the project within the strict timeframe.</p>

            <h2>FPS Demo</h2>
            <p>This project was created as portfolio piece for my creative portfolio module. It showcases how I used my current workflow to create an FPS demo in only a couple of days. It includes a wide range variety of features including state machine, navmeshes, animation sound, events, a singleton pattern for the game manager, raycasting and complex interactions. I am also extremely happy with how this project turned out visually; a unique style that focuses in on the only mechanic of killing enemies creating a satisfying user experience.</p>

            <h2>A* Pathfinding</h2>
            <p>A* Pathfinding Project was created for my advanced games engine programming project, and it includes namely hierarchical a* pathfinding that works need I say more? The module also required the creation of an editor tool so within the source you will find a unity editor level design tool. Whilst not one of the most graphically I am immensely proud with the output as I transformed the A* algorithm into a functioning pathfinding mechanic within my enemies and went even further to make it hierarchical to improve performance. It was perhaps the most complex system I have programmed yet and challenged my programming skills.</p>

            <p>Absolutely meta writing about creating the portfolio in the portfolio, however this more than anything shows I am a very adept at adapting to new environments as before this site I had no experience in web development, I really developed my CSS, HTML and JavaScript during this project. Additionally, designing my own website gave me more freedom in terms of layout and styling to create an excellent user experience for you.</p>

            <p>Emu war was made as a part of a group for the advanced gameplay development module, the opportunity of working on this project allowed me to really refine my skills for the user experience including the player controller, vehicle, map bounds and objective mechanics. In addition to the mechanics, I also produced the main menu(something I am very proud of due to it being diegetic, as well as movable map, mini map and cutscenes at the beginning and end of the game. I would add whilst I really liked what I produced, I was not happy with the way the game is unfinished mechanically or visually, however I am happy with my own contribution to the project as it was great learning experience personally for me especially in term of user experience.</p>
